"""THE STRUCTURE LAW's guard — the god-file ratchet.

Root CLAUDE.md, Priority S / rules/CODE.md -> THE STRUCTURE LAW (owner
decree 2026-07-29, SUPREME): every project carries a structure guard test
that FAILS the build when any file crosses the Violation threshold (~1,000
lines), except files named in a RATCHET allowlist that may only SHRINK.
Each entry documents why it is tolerated today and which session owes the
split. A file that heals MUST leave the list — the second test enforces
that.

The law exists because insistence without enforcement has failed
repeatedly elsewhere in this monorepo (PromptPainter's `gui.py` at 8,800
lines; Watch Academy's `defaults.py` at 3,498) — all flagged, all tolerated,
because no test failed. This one fails.

The RATCHET is EMPTY: the 2026-08-02 docs-migration inventory found no
file over ~201 lines (`gui/app.py`, the largest) anywhere in this project
— no god-files exist to tolerate.

SUFFIXES includes `.ps1` (not just `.py`, unlike most projects in this
monorepo) — `core/write_shortcuts.ps1` is a real source file and widening
the god-file check to cover it costs nothing (root `CLAUDE.md` — Icon
Forge, "Enforcement — Project Deltas"). The docs-coverage and
config-sections guards stay `.py`-only, since DOCS.md's tier system and
templates target this project's dominant stack.
